# Question 1
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

# def hello_name(user_name):
#        print(f"hello_{user_name.upper()}")  
# print(hello_name ("Saul"))

# Question 2
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

# def first_odds():
#     for num in range (1, 101, 2):
#         print(num)
# print(first_odds())   
               
# Question 3
# Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

# def max_num_in_list(a_list):
#     return max(a_list) 
# print(max_num_in_list([2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]))

               
# Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

# def is_leap_year(2014):
#     if is_leap_year is %4 == 0 and %400 == 0
#        print("is leap year")
#     elif 
#         print("not a leap year")
#         .....
               
# Question 5
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.

# def is_consecutive ([1,2,3,4,5])
#     if is_consecutive [x] - is_consecutive [x-1] == 1:
#         print("The list is consecutive.")
#     else:
#         print("The list is not consecutive.")
